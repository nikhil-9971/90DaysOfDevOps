Day 07 – Linux File System Hierarchy & Scenario-Based Practice

Task1- Linux File System Hierarchy (the most important directories)

/        → Root of everything
/bin     → Essential user commands (ls, cp, mv)
/sbin    → System/admin commands (reboot, ip, fsck)
/etc     → Configuration files (MOST IMPORTANT)
/var     → Logs & variable data
/home    → User home directories
/root    → Root user’s home
/tmp     → Temporary files
/usr     → Installed software & binaries
/opt     → Optional / third-party apps
